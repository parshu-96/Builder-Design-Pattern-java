# 🧱 Builder Design Pattern in Java

This project demonstrates how to implement the **Builder Design Pattern** in Java using a real-world example of a `User` class. 
The Builder pattern provides a flexible solution to object creation problems when an object has many fields, some of which may be optional.

---

## 📌 What is the Builder Pattern?

The Builder Pattern is a **creational design pattern** that allows you to construct complex objects step-by-step. It is especially useful when an object:
- Has many parameters (some optional)
- Needs validation before creation
- Should be immutable once created

---

## ✅ Features

- Clean and modular Java code
- Immutable `User` object with `final` fields
- Inner static `UserBuilder` class for flexible construction
- Validation for required fields (`firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, and `age`)
- Follows industry-standard naming and structure

## 💻 Code Example

### 🧑‍💼 `User` Class

```java
User user = new User.UserBuilder()
        .firstName("Parshuram")
        .lastName("Mahindrakar")
        .email("parshu@example.com")
        .age(27)
        .build();

System.out.println(user);
````

---

## 🔐 Validation

Before object creation, the builder validates:

* `firstName`, `lastName`, and `email` are not null or empty
* `email` contains '@'
* `age` is non-negative

If any validation fails, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

---

## 📚 When to Use

Use the Builder Pattern when:

* Your constructor has many parameters
* You want to avoid constructor overloading
* You need to validate before object creation
* You want readable, chainable object creation syntax

---
